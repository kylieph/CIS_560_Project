# CIS_560_Project_Jewelry_Shop

An Overview of the Project:
The Blossom Jewelry Boutique is an application -based e-commerce platform specializing in handmade jewelry. The system is designed to serve two primary user groups: customers and administrative staff. For customers, the application provides an intuitive interface to browse, search, and purchase unique jewelry items. For administrators, it offers essential inventory management features, such as the ability to add new products and discontinue existing ones. This dual-function system aims to streamline the shopping experience for users while enabling efficient backend operations for store management.

Technical Description:
Languages: 
C#, SQL - The application was developed using the IDE, Visual Studio 2022, in the language C#. Our Jewelry Boutique program consists of individual forms for each of the user interfaces. All database information is written in SQL.

Libraries: 
BCrypt.Net-Next - Whether a user is creating an account or logging in, their password will be stored using this library to hash the password into a string that cannot easily be reversed. This ensures that a user’s information is secure in the database.


The Blossom Boutique Jewelry Shop written by Kylie Phommasack, Kaitlyn Pritchard, and Tinashe Sekabanja is formatted in the following way:

- Jewelry_Project: contains all the forms and designs for the 8 forms of the project
- Data.sql: contains the insert statements
- FinalProjectCode.sql: contains the entire SQL program
- Procedures.sql: contains the procedures
- Tables.sql: contains the tables
- Project_Report: Includes example functionality & queries used
